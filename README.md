## Frameworks

- **SpringBoot(2.0):** Spring Boot makes it easy to create stand-alone.
- **SpringBoot Actuator:** SpringBootâ€™s Actuator which provides production ready features to help you monitor and manage your application.
	- This solution uses the health endpoint to check if the application is ready when deploying on kubernetes. (readinessProbe and livenessProbe)
- **Spring Data:** It makes it easy for the programming model for data access.
	- Every repository uses Spring data to access data from the database.
- **SpringBoot devtools:** Includes a set of tools to make the development experience easier. For example, Automatic Restart. When the application is launched with 'java -jar' all developer tools are disabled.
- **Liquibase:** Library responsible for versioning changes on database.
	- All scripts of this solution were made using Liquibase.
- **Sleuth:** Implements a distributed tracing solution.
	- Sleuth was used to easily track logs from different microservices.
	- With Zipkin, it's possible to track every microservice call. 
- **Swagger:** Creates a dynamic documentation for controllers.
	- Used to create a API documentation.
